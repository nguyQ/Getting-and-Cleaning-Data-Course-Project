In each vector column, the data was captured with the accelerometer and gyroscope. Each vector column contains time and frequency domain variables. 

Below are the columns definitions:

"Activity_Name" - 6 activity names each subject performed (WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)

"Subject_Number" - Identification Number indicating 1 of 30 volunteers. 

"tBodyAcc.mean...X" - mean of measured vector

"tBodyAcc.mean...Y" - mean of measured vector

"tBodyAcc.mean...Z" - mean of measured vector

"tBodyAcc.std...X" - standard deviation of measured vector

"tBodyAcc.std...Y" - standard deviation of measured vector

"tBodyAcc.std...Z" - standard deviation of measured vector
